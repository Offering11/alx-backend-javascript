6 Promises
This project contains tasks for learning to use Promises in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

Tasks To Complete

 0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep
0-promise.js contains a script that exports a function with the prototype function getResponseFromAPI(), which returns a Promise.

 1. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it
1-promise.js contains a script that exports a function with the prototype getFullResponseFromAPI(success), which returns a Promise. The parameter (success) is a boolean.

When the argument is:
true
Resolve the promise by passing an object with 2 attributes:
status: 200
body: 'Success'
false
Reject the promise with an error object with the message The fake API is not working currently.
